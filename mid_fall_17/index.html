	to keep warm 
		in the winter

the heat goes off at hours where the central machine
has decided the sleep
carpet is unconductive. inconductive.
then hear the owner's heartbeat 
	ears and throat

sneaking through in births    valleys of silence 
with the sun
inconductoring
the floor holds to cold
like tar on lungs
who is outside ? and up now ?
bare static. malconduct.
