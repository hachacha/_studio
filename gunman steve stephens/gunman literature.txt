After the fatal shooting of the self-taught mechanic and grandfather of 14, authorities nationwide scrambled for two days to find Stephens.
The three-day manhunt ended Tuesday after the killer stopped at a McDonald's in Harborcreek Township, Pennsylvania, 100 miles from the scene of the killing.
His craving for fries and chicken McNuggets led him to the fast food restaurant, where an employee recognized him and called police.

Suspect in this case is a bm Steve Stephens 6’1 244 bald with a full beard. Wearing dark blue and grey or black striped polo shirt. White or cream colored SUV. Armed and dangerous. If seen call 9-1-1. Do not approach.

Stephens was two cars behind in the drive-thru lane to pick up food, and by this time, the police were on their way, DuCharme said.
Stephens took his nuggets, but employees told him he had to wait for the fries. They were trying to give police time to arrive, DuCharme said. But Stephens didn't wait and he drove away, the owner said.
DuCharme said Stephens looked suspicious.
"I've been doing this for 34 years. [Stephens] didn't want his money, he wanted the nuggets and to leave," he said.
The last thing he said 'was my name'
On Tuesday, two of Godwin's daughters, Debbie Godwin and Tonya Godwin-Baines, met with Joy Lane, the woman who identified herself as Stephens' former girlfriend, CNN affiliate WJW reported.
The women, who didn't know each other, hugged, prayed and cried.
"The hashtags Joy Lane, Joy Lane massacre -- I don't even know who Joy Lane is anymore, or how to pick up all the pieces of my world at this moment," Lane said, the station reported. "I've got a lot of negative comments. Some even said he should have killed me."
WJW said Lane told Godwin's daughters: "I feel bad ... The last thing that he would have said was my name and didn't know me or why he was saying it. And that's been difficult."
She and Stephens had dated for a while, Lane said. They last talked on Saturday night. Stephens told Lane he had quit his job and was moving out of state, she said.



“His dying doesn’t make any of us feel better,” said Joe Tate, who lived directly across the street from where Godwin had been killed by Stephens. “It was so weird on that day it happened, so strange where people are having family over for Easter Sunday dinner, and a good man is shot for reasons that we will never really know exactly. Sometimes, as horrible as violent crime can be, you can somehow understand why and it makes a little sense. But this makes no sense and never will.”

“All I know is that everyone in our family—all of our children and grandchildren—and everyone else in this neighborhood, has the same feeling,” Tate continued. “It could have been one of us if we had been outside at that time. I still can’t get that out of my mind. Could have been me or my family or one of our neighbors.”

"I’m at the point where I snapped… I got a lot of built up anger and frustration."



saying he deleted the video "because it's so disturbing and upset a lot of people." Simpson further explained, "I understand that and feared that it would — that's why I warned people about watching it — but decided to post it because it was all over the internet and every TV station in the country."

In addition to improving our reporting flows, we are constantly exploring ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment. Artificial intelligence, for example, plays an important part in this work, helping us prevent the videos from being reshared in their entirety. (People are still able to share portions of the videos in order to condemn them or for public awareness, as many news outlets are doing in reporting the story online and on television). ...Keeping our global community safe is an important part of our mission. We are grateful to everyone who reported these videos and other offensive content to us, and to those who are helping us keep Facebook safe every day.


Again, just another example of common sense of people in this country slowly eroding down to nothing.

Remember, his name is "God win." Maybe that means something.

He had been picking up soda cans while taking an after dinner walk when Stephens pulled up to him. Less than a minute later Godwin was dead. Laying on the sidewalk next to an eight-foot high chain link fence that blocked off about four acres of a vacant lot that used to house a public elementary school.

...Since the murder on Sunday, the street where the killing occurred has seen non-stop traffic from media shooting film and the public attaching nearly 100 foil balloons to the fence Godwin lay next to bleeding to death.

“We are glad it is over,” said Anthony Whitmore, who lives a few streets over. “It was so weird it happened on the religious day of resurrection, a day of us celebrating life, and then this was all about death. With the media and the curiosity seekers gone soon, the people on this street can now maybe go back to living their lives.”

...The restaurant’s manager said in an interview with the New York Times that Stephens bought a 20-piece order of Chicken McNuggets and a large order of French fries for $5.35 at the drive-through. The restaurant employees recognized him and tried to stall him by withholding his order of large fries for a few minutes.

“He asked me to come in and see his pet bird, so I went in their house. He had a parakeet and he had that bird crawl from the cage and on to his finger. Then he slapped the bird as hard as he could with his other hand, and the bird was lying on the floor. The bird looked dead to me. I looked at him and he was smiling and laughing as he looked at me and that bird.”

“Hey, animals don’t make you weird like that,” Henderson said. “He was that way before he got that bird. Heard he used to torture other pets he had. He was like that from the time I first met him.”

He also mentions that extreme videos of that nature can be triggering to people who have experienced violent trauma themselves. According to Arnold, one way people can mitigate the trauma they experience is by sharing the load with others, who then are able to discuss it with them. He says:

“It’s one of those things that’s so outrageous that to just hold it and contain it is hard to do. You want to, in some way, have somebody that connects to that experience with you because being affected by it and not having anybody connect to you with regard to your reaction to seeing it is going to make it even harder for you to cope with what you’ve seen.”

This is a major reason that people continue to post and share the video, even though they know it’s disturbing.
