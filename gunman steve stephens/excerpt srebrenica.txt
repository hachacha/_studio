I am talking now about the night of
12th to 13th July 1995. We sat pressed close together. There was no space any more
between people and I could not move. I spent that night at the bus depot. I saw people
in helmets, but I could not recognize them. Suddenly I heard a woman screaming that
UN soldiers killed children. I thought that this woman had lost her mind. I could not
imagine that UN soldiers would do such a thing. The rumour spread that soldiers had
killed the son of this woman, a child of about thirteen years old. Suddenly many women
began to scream because they saw how their daughters were being taken away. The
screaming was so loud that it was unreal.
