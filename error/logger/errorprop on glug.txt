but infinity is not possible for humans especially given the current state of our environment.
chine which calls for infinite tape reading and executing and writing. the turing machine is infinite but infinity is not possible for humans especially given the current state of our environment.

a backspace or a deletion on a computer is never registered as an erasure from the typing interface. it is it's own unique character that represents a failure (08 in decimal). to the typist's eyes that mistake has been wiped clear but it has a place on the memory of the computer. there's the failure and the character that is the exclamation point next to the failure. 

failures are not meant to be covered. time still drives forward whether they are regarded or not. exposing these realities and including them into the mental model of the society is a necessity that is often overlooked. failure still takes time and energy and therefore should be still seen as just as fundamental and worthwhile as success and "progress".
