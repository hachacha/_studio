eRR0R

in a world that covers its flaws in the blinding light of universal truths and institutionally reinforced regimes of visibility, we are interested in the fertile shades opened up by errors. the antiseptic intellectual environment our societies try to achieve, while arguably “healthy” and “safe” for the established values, has the huge disadvantage of obscuring any fundamentally different modes of existence. we are looking for submissions that explore the fertility of errors and question our inherited worldview.

eRR0R will open in arrhythmicity (VR exhibition space at arr.dalpofzs.com) in march 2018

submit your work by email at postoffice@dalpofzs.com
please include a short description of your practice. 
links to your website or presence on social media are welcomed. 

deadline for submission 28.02.2018

By resurrecting the dead we solve the problem of alienation from time. Together, they facilitate a grand unification of space-time in a metaphysics of kinship.

progress involves superiority not only over the fathers (still alive) and ancestors (already dead) but also over animals … Progress makes fathers and ancestors into the accused and the sons and descendants into judges; historians are judges over the deceased, that is, those to have already endured capital punishment (the death penalty), while the sons sit in judgment over those who have not yet died.
