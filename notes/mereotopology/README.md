Qualitative Spatial Representation 
QSR provides a way of representing aspects of the spatial knowledge expressed in terms of this kind in a computational way.

Euclidean Geometry is rigid. Two triangles in the plane where one can be transformed into the other by rigid motions that do not change lengths or angles are essentially the same triangle, that is Euclidean geometry cannot distinguish them. Topology is more flexible. A triangle and a circle are topologically indistinguishable because the bending of the triangle’s sides to become the circumference of the circle is a continuous transformation, more precisely an invertible, or reversible, continuous transformation that does not change the topological properties of the triangle. The distinction between Euclidean geometry and topology is exploited by De Landa 8 in expounding Deleuze’s use of difference. Euclidean geometry has more differences than topology, as in the example of the circle and the triangle. However, we shall see that topology, in the mathematically conventional sense of ‘point-set topology’ still makes distinctions that appear to have no part in bodily experience.


The key aspect of regions is that they arise from bodily experience; we can imagine moving through a three-dimensional region, a surface of finite extent can be correlated with the experience of moving the hand over a physical surface. Such regions exist as surfaces or volumes of experience without being constructed out of infinitesimal points as in a topological space.
*surfaces volumes of experience*

In the case of a physical body, regions have no such neat demarcations, but it could be argued that the thumb is connected, as a three-dimensional spatial region, to its corresponding palm without overlapping it, and the palm overlaps the hand as a whole. In another three-dimensional example, two objects in contact, such as a glass resting on a table, would be connected.


the key idea is that a closed set includes its boundary points while an open set excludes them. The choice between modelling the desk as an open or a closed set only involves the coordinate locations exactly 72cm above the floor. If we choose the open option then these do not belong to the desk; if the closed option, then they do. This choice has no physical meaning in bodily experience
