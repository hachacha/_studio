				20. Each time I visit a certain area, I get the message "Call Lost" or I can't make
				or receive calls on my cell phone. I suspect that someone is using a cell phone
				jammer, but how can I tell for sure?</p>
				<p><i>Losing a signal does not necessarily mean that someone nearby is using a cell phone
				jammer. In fact, signal loss can be caused by many factors, such as signal blockage by
				buildings or natural obstructions, unusually heavy call volume in the area, being too far
				from a cell tower, or being outside of a service providerâ€™s coverage or roaming area. Cell
				phone users are encouraged to contact their service provider to ensure that coverage is
				available. If there are no service disruptions and there is interference to authorized
				communications, the FCC's Enforcement Bureau may use specialized equipment to
				identify the specific location of a jammer. </i><a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/jammerenforcement/jamfaq.pdf">fcc doc</a></p>
