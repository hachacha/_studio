			<i>concept</i>
			: at its basis this would be creating a situation where people expect one thing and then are presented with something completely other.

		<p><i>maximize freedom & eliminate favoritism</i> unless unfettered</p>
		<p>to clash against bureacracy brings on other emotions of anger, frustration, helplessness. this occurs in nature as well." why can't things be this way? to my liking? ease?" <br/>does bureacracy immitate nature?</p>
		<!-- <p> --</p> -->
		
		<h3>1: the emotion evoked from a bureacracy</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/health/cuckolding-sex-kerner/index.html">
					<i>Initially viewed as a heterosexual phenomenon, it's increasingly prevalent among gay men, too. "I'd long gotten letters from straight couples into cuckolding (usually initiated by the husband), but none from gay couples until after marriage equality began to gather steam," explained writer and activist Savage. To learn more, Savage joined with Lehmiller and Ley for a study of cuckolding fantasies and experiences in 580 gay men.</i>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>this implies that the intsutution of marriage and corresponding bureaucratic system of legitimization by the state-- a higher power -- has an influence on the sexual desire within a human</b>
					</li>
					<li>comfort or sexual explorations influenced by systems of control -- control? legitimzation?</li>
					<li>comfort in union? civilization holding hand in saying that certain things are okay to perform? and thus creating a bodily response?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>people who take comfort in structures -- accountants, actuaries, bean counters</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>2: deification of self-organization and questions of free will</h3>
		<p>
			<b>ch 5 the village mayor <i>franz kafka's <u>the castle</u></i></b>	
		</p>
		<blockquote>...in his experience so far, official dealings with the count's authorities had been very simple. one reason was that <span style="background-color:yellow;"><a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/freewi-m/" target="_blank">a definite decision on his own affairs had obviously been made once and for all</a></span>, apprently in his favor, and another was the <span style="background-color:yellow;">admirable</span> consistency of the offices involved, which you could sense was particularly good in cases where <span style="background-color:yellow;">no such thing appeared to be present</span>. when K. thought about all this he was not far from considering his situation satisfactory although after such cheering moments he always told himself that this was just where the danger lay. direct communication with the authorities was not too difficult, for well-organized as they might be, those <span style="background-color:yellow;"><a href="Apocolocyntosis.html" target="_blank">authorities had only to defend something remote, in the name of remote</a></span> and indeed invisible gentlemen, whereas <span style="background-color:yellow;">K. was fighting for something very close to him, for himself</span>, and doing so, <span style="background-color:yellow;">at least at first, of his own free will</span>, for he was the one on the attack.</span></blockquote>
		<br/>
		deification and becoming as god. 
		in bureacracy the system is god and to fight for yourself is to be going against Him. deification would require you to also be part of the bureacratic system.  elevated to the point of god by becoming part of it. losing the self. 
		<br/>

		<h3>3: upsetting expectations & upsetting reality</h3>
		<p>this is a bit different from free will and one's exercising of it. we have become accustomed to specifics in our culture that when we participate in a culture, large (polity) or small (scene) we are going to receive specific capital ($, protections, clout). participating in the gallery scene and specifically the opening party you expect: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>art</li>
				<ul>
					<li>put that fucking degree to work</li>
				</ul>
			<li>free wine/beer</li>
				<ul>
					<li>it is free</li>
					<li>it is "social lubricant"</li>
				</ul>
			<li>socialization based around the art or libations or socialization</li>
			<ul>
				<li>instagram opportunities</li>
				<li>being seen physically/ass sniffing</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		
<hr/>
		<p>particulars for social climate to respond to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>class inequality</li>
			<li>race---eh</li>
			<li>state of the gallery in modern art world</li>
				<ul>
					<li>go for free wine and faux socialization</li>
					<li>an instagram photo opportunity</li>
					<li>end up not seeing art at all</li>
					
				</ul>
			<li>tech & privacy</li>
				<ul>
					<li>how ready people are to give up their private information</li>
					<li>display it publically as part of the exhibition.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
